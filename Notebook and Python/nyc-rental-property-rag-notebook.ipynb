The median monthly income in New York City is around $50,500. In Manhattan, the median income is between $40,400 and $45,800. For a three-person family, it is more than $60,200. A four- or five-year-old child in a family of four in Queens is worth about as much as a four year old in NYC. If you are a married couple, you can expect to pay about half of your monthly mortgage payments in one year. You can also expect a mortgage payment of about one-third of the monthly payments. This means that you will have to make about two times as many payments as you would if you were married. It is important to note that the mortgage is not a guarantee of future income. There is no guarantee that your home will be worth more in future years than it will in your present. However, if your house is valued at $500, $600, or $700, then you may be able to afford to buy a home that is at least $100,001. That is, a house worth $200, 000. But if the house has a value of $300,00, and you have a $400,0000 mortgage, that house will not be valued as high as it would be if it were valued in today's dollars.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":61},{"cell_type":"code","source":"st.title('NY Rental Properties RAG Model')\n\nif 'history' not in st.session_state:\n    st.session_state.history = []\n\ndef handle_query(query):\n    answer = answer_query(query)\n    st.session_state.history.append({\"query\": query, \"answer\": answer})\n\nfor entry in st.session_state.history:\n    st.write(f\"**Question**: {entry['query']}\")\n    st.write(f\"**Answer**: {entry['answer']}\")\n    st.write(\"---\")  \n\nquery = st.text_input('Ask a question about NY rental properties:')\n\nif query:\n    handle_query(query)\n    st.experimental_rerun()  ","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-29T19:24:27.667023Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-29T19:24:27.667402Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-29T19:24:27.682732Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-29T19:24:27.667361Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-29T19:24:27.681833Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"2024-11-29 19:24:27.670 Thread 'MainThread': missing ScriptRunContext!

In Manhattan, it is around $4,400. The average price of a New Yorker apartment in Manhattan is just $6,800.\n--------------------------------------------------\n**Question**: What are the most popular room types?\n**Answer**: Context: Park Slope Manhattan Manhattan\nQuestion: What are the most popular room types?\nAnswer: The most common room type is the one that is most likely to be the first to get a lot of attention.\nThe most important thing to remember is that the room is not a place to sit or sit down. It is a space where you can sit and relax. The room should be comfortable and comfortable for you. If you are not comfortable, you will not be able to enjoy the experience. You will be disappointed. There are many different types of rooms in Manhattan. Some are more comfortable than others. Others are less comfortable. In the case of the Manhattan Room, there are a few different rooms that are all different. These rooms are usually the ones that you would like to stay in. They are often the rooms where the people you want to meet will stay. Most of these rooms have a large number of people. This is because the number and type of room are so different from the other rooms. For example, if you have two people in a room, one of them will have to go to the bathroom and the second person will go into the kitchen. So, the more people there, and more room space, it is more likely that there will also be more of a group of friends. Also, some rooms may have more than one person. Therefore, a person who is in one room may not have the same amount of space as someone who has a different room. However, this is usually because there is less room for people to hang out.\n--------------------------------------------------\n**Question**: What is the price range for a 2-Bedroom apartment?\n**Answer**: Context: Park Slope Lower East Side Manhattan\nQuestion: What is the price range for a 2-Bedroom apartment?\nAnswer: $1,000-$2,500 per month.\nThe average price for 2 Bedrooms in Manhattan is $2.5 million. The average rent for an apartment in the Lower West Side is about $3,200 per year. In Manhattan, the average monthly rent is around $4,400. If you are looking for affordable housing, you should consider the following options:\n\n1. Rent a two bedroom apartment. This is a great option for those who are in a hurry to get to work. It is affordable and has a lot of amenities. You can rent a single bedroom for $500 a month, or you can buy a three bedroom unit for about the same price. There are a few other options, but the most common is to rent an extra bedroom in your home. 2. Buy a one bedroom home in New York City. These are the cheapest options. They are not as expensive as the other two options but they are more affordable. 3. Get a second home for less than $100,00. A second apartment is not a bad deal. 4. Find a place to live in Brooklyn. Many people are living in apartments in Queens, Brooklyn, and Brooklyn Heights. However, there are many other places to stay in NYC. 5. Go to a local hotel. Some hotels offer a variety of options for rent. Here are some of the best hotels in NY: 6. Check out the New Jersey City Hotels. Most of these hotels are located in Jersey. 7. Take a walk in one of their hotels. One of them is called the \"Hotel Jersey.\" 8. Visit a restaurant.\n--------------------------------------------------\n**Question**: How many reviews are there on properties in Manhattan?\n**Answer**: Context: Manhattan Manhattan Manhattan\nQuestion: How many reviews are there on properties in Manhattan?\nAnswer: The average review is about 1,000.\nThe average reviews on a property in New York City are about 2,500. The reviews that are on the property are usually about the same as the reviews of the other properties. So, if you have a lot of properties, you might get a few reviews. But if the average is less than 1 million, then you're not getting a good review. If you are getting reviews from a couple of different people, it's not a bad thing. It's just that you don't get the best reviews for the properties you own. You get reviews about properties that have been around for a long time. And that's why you get so many good reviews, because you can get them from people who have lived in the area for years. They're just not as good as you would get from someone who lives in a different part of town. That's the reason why I think that the number of reviews is so high. I don' think it is a coincidence that there are so few good properties on Manhattan. There are a number that I would say are very good. One of them is the New Jersey State Fair. In New Brunswick, there is an old building that is called the State House. This building is in an area that has been used for many years by the state. When you look at the history of New England, the building was used as a hotel. Now, when you go to the Fair, they have the old buildings. New Hampshire has a similar building.\n--------------------------------------------------\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":63}]}
